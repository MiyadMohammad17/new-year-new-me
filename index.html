              A lack of perseverance is a major roadblock to success. So many
              extremely bright and accomplished people fail time and time again
              as a result of their over-reliance on their abilities. They aren't
              willing to keep trying until they've perfected what they're doing.
              Instead, when things become tough, they give up.
